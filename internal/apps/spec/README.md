# App Schema Generation

We need to supply raw json schemas to several tools under the App platform services. We also need to ensure that the
schema has all the necessary comments so that the models have all the context they need when working with AppSpec. 

## Updating the schema

When godo is updated, we need to copy the `apps.gen.go` file over and re-run the generate command.
